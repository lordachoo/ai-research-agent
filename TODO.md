# TODO LIST

## Agent System Prompts

- Parameterize, Expose (print them in the UI), and make customizable all prompts - system prompt, base_system_prompt, kb, no_kb prompts
	- Visualize them on a different ui/screen? 

## Knowledge Base

- Multiple KB Support
	- KB Management View - Create, View (Click Into KB), Delete KB, Switch to "Currently Selected KB" that the Agents use for prompts at that time, select "DEFAULT KB" for Agent
		- Show KB Sizes (du -sh via python exec?)
	- Possibly look at an attribute for the scheduler to SELECT which KB is used, if not fall back to DEFAULT KB
